    <h1>James Anderson</h1>
    James Michael Anderson OBE (born 30 July 1982) is an English international cricketer who plays for the England Test cricket team and Lancashire, and previously played for England's limited overs cricket teams. Anderson is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time by English cricket fans.[1] He holds the record for most wickets by a pace bowler in Test cricket history, having taken over 650 Test wickets.
    In domestic cricket, he represents Lancashire County Cricket Club. Anderson was a member of the England team that won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20.
    Anderson made his Test debut in 2003, played for England's One-Day International (ODI) team between 2002 and 2015, and played for England's Twenty20 International (T20I) team between 2007 and 2009.[2] On the occasion of England's 1,000th Test in 2018, Anderson was named in the country's greatest all-time Test XI by the England and Wales Cricket Board.[3] As of July 2023, he is ranked as the number four Test bowler in the world in the ICC Men's Player Rankings.[4]
    Anderson plays as a right-arm fast-medium bowler. Among fast bowlers, he is the leading Test wicket-taker of all-time, being the first fast bowler to have taken 600 or more Test wickets, and is England's record Test wicket-taker.[5] He has played the most Test matches for England, and the second-most of any cricketer, behind Sachin Tendulkar.[6] He is also England's highest wicket-taker in ODIs with 269.[7] As a batsman, he and Joe Root hold the world record for highest tenth-wicket stand in Tests (198).[8]
